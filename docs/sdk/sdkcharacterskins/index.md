3. Name the Data Asset same name of the asset you wish to replace, for instance `CharacterSkin_UIU_Light_LongSleeve`, this will replace the Long Sleeve UIU skin in-game.
4. Set your own meshes for the **First Person, First Person Legs and Third Person overrides.** Set the **Display Name** and **Usable Factions** to be usable in-game!
