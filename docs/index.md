# Introduction

Welcome! This site hosts the unofficial modding documentation for SCP:5K.

Please note that **the site is a work in progress,** and certain sections may be incomplete or lack detailed information. The source code for this site is available on GitHub, and community contributions are always welcome.

:::danger
As SCP:5K is currently in its alpha development stage, some parts of this documentation may become outdated. While it was primarily created for version **0.16.0**, it is not necessarily limited to this version and will likely remain relevant.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to have basic understanding of `Unreal Engine 4` and other programs associated, such as image editing programs, or Visual Studio/Blueprint Script for the more advanced.
